# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component

![Design preview for the Interactive rating component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Hi, there! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸ’» About the project

This challenge was about building out an interactive rating component and getting it looking as close to the design as possible above.


## ðŸ›  Technologies 
This project was developed with the following technologies:
- ### Javascript
  â–¶ On JS, I was able to practice querySeletor and querySelectorAll and its behavior on the code in general, using, for example, the prototype forEach() as a way to go through every element of the NodeList. 
- ### HTML
  â–¶ On HTML, I was able to organize my code and anticipate myself for future ideas that might have shown up during coding. For example, creating another "div" with a class "close". Doing do, through JS, I was able to create a function that would switch screens by only adding/removing the class.
- ### CSS
  â–¶ On CSS, I could practice a lot about hover, active and focus on HTML tags to add some good effects on the elements.
